# Spotify Project

This was a hobby project that I started working on to get a hang of Python, Flask and Web Development in general. Why does it matter to me? Well, had to start somewhere.

### The tech used was:
* Python (Flask) for the backend
* HTML, CSS using Jinja2 for the frontend
* Bootstrap for Styling

It was a fun project to work on, got to learn about API's, how to consume them and basically what they are used for.
